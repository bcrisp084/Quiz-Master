# Quiz-Master

A light weight working progress quiz app

## Description

This is a fun spare time project to keep the fundamentals flowing.
The app is published to github pages. I have added the option to choose an easy set
of questions or a hard set. There is a timer that will penalize you for wrong answers
and there will also be a score keeper to tally all correct answers. There will be music to indicate if the answer picked was correct or not. This app is still being worked on and is not
fully completed.
